When one feature is on small range; say 0 to 10 while the other one is on a large range (suppose 0 to 10000); ML algorithms donot perform well. We have to scale the features so that both of them takes a comparable ranges of values to each other. In simpler terms, it means transforming data into a common range of values.</description></item><item><title>Day 2- Interpreting Classification Models</title><link>https://shikshya1.github.io/portfolio/30-days-of-ml/project-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 10:58:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://shikshya1.github.io/portfolio/30-days-of-ml/project-2/</guid><description>Interpreting Classification Models When we are building classification models; we are most of the time concerned about the performance criteria (how accurate the model is to classify the output labels). We donot look for explanations as to why it decided to classify the input to a certain class. But there are situations where questioning the decision of classification model becomes necessary.
Suppose we are building classifier that identifies psam emails. It identifies certain email as &amp;lsquo;spam&amp;rsquo; and moves it to spam folder rather than placing it in inbox folder without the need of human intervention.</description></item></channel></rss>

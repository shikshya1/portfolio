Cosine similarity Cosine similarity measures how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. It is a judgment of orientation and not magnitude. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together.</description></item><item><title>Day 4- Text Classification</title><link>https://shikshya1.github.io/portfolio/30-days-of-ml/project-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:58:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://shikshya1.github.io/portfolio/30-days-of-ml/project-4/</guid><description>Text Classification Classification categorizes data into one or more known classes. The data can be text, speech, image or numeric. Classification is used in wide range of applications across multiple domains such as: social media, healthcare, e-commerce etc. In today&amp;rsquo;s post, I will be exploring text classification.
This notebook linked with this post demostrates how to use several ML algorigthms for the disaster classification task. The models built for this purpose in this notebook are:</description></item></channel></rss>

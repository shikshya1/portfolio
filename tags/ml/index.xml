When one feature is on small range; say 0 to 10 while the other one is on a large range (suppose 0 to 10000); ML algorithms donot perform well. We have to scale the features so that both of them takes a comparable ranges of values to each other. In simpler terms, it means transforming data into a common range of values.</description></item></channel></rss>

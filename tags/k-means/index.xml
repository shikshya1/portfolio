customer segmentation is a process of dividing customers into different groups based on their characteristics. This can be useful for mall management in order to better understand their customers and tailor marketing strategies to different groups. One popular method for customer segmentation is k-means clustering, which is a machine learning technique that groups similar data points together. In this article, we will be discussing how to use the k-means algorithm in Python to perform customer segmentation for a mall.</description></item></channel></rss>

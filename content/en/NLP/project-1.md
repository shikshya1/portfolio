NLP : 

"As we all know, dealing with natural language is hard. It is hard from the standpoint of the child, who must spend many years acquiring a language (compare this
time span to that required for the acquisition of motor skills such as eating solids,
walking, or swimming), it is hard for the adult language learner, it is hard for the
scientist who attempts to model the relevant phenomena, and it is hard for the engineer who attempts to build systems that deal with natural language input or output.
These tasks are so hard that Turing (1950) could rightly make fluent conversation in
natural language the centerpiece of his test for intelligence." (Andr√°s Kornai- Mathematical Lingusitics)

Some of the NLP tasks are:

Sentence Classification.
NER
Text Generation
Translate/Summarize text
Answering a question


Generic NLP pipeline is divided into 8 major steps:

1) Data Acquisition
2) Text cleaning
3) Pre-processing
4) Feature Engineering
5) Modeling
6) Evaluation
7) Deployment
8) Monitoring and model updating

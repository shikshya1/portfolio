Classification categorizes data into one or more known classes. The data can be text, speech, image or numeric. Classification is used in wide range of applications across multiple domains such as: social media, healthcare, e-commerce etc. In today's post, I will be exploring text classification.

This notebook linked with this post demostrates how to use several ML algorigthms for the disaster classification task. The models built for this purpose in this notebook are:

1) Multinomial NB

2) Logistic Regression

3) SVM

4) Random Forest Classifier

5) LSTM + GLOVE

6) BERT
